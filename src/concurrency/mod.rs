//! Concurrency Management Module - Flagship Feature
//!
//! This module provides a sophisticated, unified concurrency control system for Docker image
//! operations. It consolidates all concurrency-related functionality that was previously
//! scattered across multiple files, offering advanced features like dynamic adjustment,
//! performance monitoring, intelligent task scheduling, and comprehensive progress tracking.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! ### ðŸš€ **Advanced Concurrency Management**
//! - **Adaptive Concurrency**: Machine learning-based optimization with intelligent strategy selection
//! - **Dynamic Adjustment**: Real-time adjustment based on performance metrics
//! - **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking with regression analysis
//! - **Intelligent Strategy Selection**: Automatic strategy switching based on conditions
//!
//! ### ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Monitoring & Statistics**
//! - Real-time performance tracking with regression analysis
//! - Layer-level progress tracking and statistics
//! - Operation-level statistics and reporting
//! - Statistical trend detection and prediction
//!
//! ### ðŸ”§ **Flexible Configuration**
//! - Hierarchical configuration structure with validation
//! - Predefined optimized configurations for common scenarios
//! - Runtime adjustment capabilities
//! - Strategy-specific parameter tuning
//!
//! ### ðŸŽ¯ **Unified Interface**
//! - Single point of integration for all concurrency needs
//! - Consistent API across different concurrency strategies
//! - Seamless integration with registry operations
//! - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
//!
//! ## Usage Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use docker_image_pusher::concurrency::{ConcurrencyConfig, AdaptiveConcurrencyManager};
//! use docker_image_pusher::logging::Logger;
//! 
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Create adaptive concurrency configuration
//! let config = ConcurrencyConfig::default()
//!     .with_max_concurrent(16)
//!     .enable_dynamic_concurrency(true)
//!     .with_speed_threshold(50.0);
//!     
//! // Initialize adaptive concurrency manager
//! let manager = AdaptiveConcurrencyManager::new(config);
//! 
//! // Acquire permits for concurrent operations
//! let permits = manager.acquire_permits(4).await?;
//! // ... perform operations with permits
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! This module replaces and consolidates the following previously scattered functionality:
//! - Registry progress tracking (`src/registry/progress.rs` - REMOVED)
//! - Registry statistics (`src/registry/stats.rs` - REMOVED) 
//! - Registry streaming (`src/registry/streaming.rs` - REMOVED)
//! - Registry strategy (`src/registry/strategy.rs` - REMOVED)
//! - Various pipeline-specific concurrency handling
//!
//! All concurrency logic is now centralized here for better maintainability,
//! feature richness, and performance optimization.
