## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v0.2.x to v0.3.0

**No Breaking Changes**: Version 0.3.0 is fully backward compatible with v0.2.x.

**New Features Available**:
```bash
# Enhanced progress display (automatically enabled with --verbose)
docker-image-pusher -r registry.com/app:v1.0 -f image.tar -u user -p pass --verbose

# Automatic concurrency optimization (existing --max-concurrent flag enhanced)
docker-image-pusher -r registry.com/app:v1.0 -f image.tar -u user -p pass --max-concurrent 6 --verbose
```

**Performance Improvements**:
- Better progress visualization
- Smarter concurrency management
- More accurate ETA predictions
- Enhanced error reporting

### Migrating from v0.1.x to v0.2.0

**Breaking Changes**:
- Update import paths if using as a library: `docker_image_pusher::output` → `docker_image_pusher::logging`
- Error type changes: `PusherError` → `RegistryError`

**Command Line**: No breaking changes for CLI usage.

**Improvements**:
- More reliable operation with unified pipeline
- Better error messages
- Improved performance
- Simplified codebase for better maintainability
